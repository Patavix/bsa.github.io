          The Third Wave of Technological Advancements in Blockchain: Exploring
          the Application of Zero-Knowledge Proof Technology
        </h2>

          Information leakage incidents have become commonplace whether the
          information is stored on the Internet or in offline archives, whether
          it is due to a subjective intent or objective accident. As long as the
          information is stored centrally, it is vulnerable to attack from a
          single point. If the verification process requires a trusted third
          party, moral hazard and inefficiency will inevitably occur. The
          solution to information security is essential and urgent. The
          zero-knowledge proof technology allows users to perform verification
          more efficiently and securely while protecting their privacy. Suppose
          Bitcoin is the first invention that blockchain brought to the real
          world, providing a new way to store value, and Ethereum's smart
          contract is the second milestone that unlocked the potential of
          innovation. In that case, the application of zero-knowledge proof is
          the third and most significant wave of technological innovation in the
          history of blockchain development, bringing privacy and scalability.
          This is an essential part of the Web3 ecosystem and a vital
          fundamental technology with the potential to promote social
          transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article introduces the application scenario, working principle,
          development status, and future trend of Zero-Knowledge Proof from a
          non-technical perspective to let readers without a technical
          background know about the great changes that Zero-Knowledge Proof will
          bring.
        </p>

        <h4><strong> 1. What is Zero-Knowledge Proof?</strong></h4>
        <p>
          Consider an individual who wishes to verify ownership of another
          person's phone number as an illustrative scenario. In order to prove
          this claim without revealing the actual number, a method is needed
          that allows proof without revealing the number. This concept is
          embodied in Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP), a cryptographic construct that
          provides a robust mechanism for information disclosure. The use of ZKP
          facilitates the retention of data ownership, enhances privacy
          protection, and significantly mitigates the risks associated with data
          breaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three distinct attributes support the Zero-Knowledge Proof
          paradigm:<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Integrity<br />
          If a statement is true, an honest verifier will be convinced by an
          honest prover. That is, right cannot be wrong.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Rationality<br />
          If a statement is false, in most cases, a deceitful prover cannot
          convince an honest verifier of the false statement. That is, wrong
          cannot be right.<br />
        </p>
        <p>Zero-knowledge</p>
        <p>
          If a statement is true, the verifier cannot learn any additional
          information other than that the statement is true. A zero-knowledge
          proof has a small probability of producing a rationality error, that
          is, a cheating prover can make the verifier believe a false statement.
          Zero-knowledge proof is a proof of probability, not of certainty, but
          we can reduce the rationality error to negligible by some techniques.
        </p>

        <h4><strong>2. The Application of Zero-Knowledge Proof</strong></h4>

        <p>
          The two most crucial application scenarios of zero-knowledge proof are
          privacy and scalability.
        </p>
        <p>2.1 Privacy</p>
        <p>
          Zero-knowledge proof allows users to safely share necessary
          information to obtain goods and services without revealing personal
          information and to avoid hacking and disclosing personal identity
          information. With the gradual integration of digital and physical
          fields, the privacy protection function of zero-knowledge proof
          becomes very important for information security for Web3 and even
          beyond Web3. If there is no zero-knowledge proof, user information
          will exist in a trusted third-party database, which is potentially
          dangerous to be attacked by hackers. Zcash, a privacy-focused token
          designed to conceal transaction details, can exemplify the inaugural
          application of zero-knowledge proofs in blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>2.1.1 Protecting and Verifying Identity Information</p>
        <p>
          In contemporary digital interactions, individuals often provide
          personal information such as names, birth dates, email addresses, and
          complex passwords to prove authorized access. As a result, inadvertent
          exposure of sensitive information on digital platforms exists. An
          emerging concern is the prevalence of fraudulent telephone
          communications in which recipients are addressed by name, underscoring
          the critical implications of personal data dissemination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blockchain technology offers a solution by providing encrypted digital
          identifiers that encapsulate individual data. This digital
          manifestation creates a "decentralized identity," an entity resistant
          to forgery or alteration without the owner's consent. Such a
          decentralized system gives users the prerogative to delineate access
          permissions to their identities. It allows them to substantiate
          citizenship without the direct display of passport details.
          Furthermore, this system can streamline the verification process and
          reduce the frequency of access denials due to password amnesia.Within
          this framework, the zero-knowledge proof is derived from public
          records, providing evidence of a user's identity and confidential
          records for user authentication during service engagement. This
          approach not only refines the verification paradigm and improves user
          engagement, but also eliminates the need for centralized repositories
          of user data.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, zero-knowledge proofing can create a private reputation
          system that allows service providers to verify that users meet certain
          reputation standards without revealing their identities. Users can
          anonymously export reputations from platforms such as Twitter and
          GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>2.1.2 Anonymous Payment</p>
        <p>
          The transaction details of bank payments are usually visible to many
          parties, including payment providers, banks, and the government, which
          exposes the privacy of ordinary citizens to some extent, and users
          need to trust the relevant parties not to do evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cryptocurrency can get rid of third parties by directly conducting
          peer-to-peer transactions. However, the transactions on the mainstream
          public chain are publicly visible. Although the users' address is
          anonymous, there is still a way to find the real-world identity by
          analyzing the associated address on the chain and the information such
          as KYC from the exchange or Twitter off the chain. Knowing a person's
          wallet address is equivalent to checking a person's bank account
          balance at any time and may even threaten the user's identity and
          property.
        </p>
        <p>
          The zero-knowledge proof can provide anonymous payment from three
          levels: privacy tokens, applications, and public chains. Privacy
          tokens such as Zcash and Monero hide transaction details, including
          senders and receivers' addresses, asset types, quantity, and times.
          Tornado Cash is a decentralized application in Ethereum that uses
          zero-knowledge proof to confuse transaction details to ensure privacy
          transfer (but is also used by hackers to launder money). Aleo is a
          Layer1 blockchain that aims to provide privacy features for
          applications at the protocol level.
        </p>
        <p>2.1.3 Honest Behavior</p>
        <p>
          Zero-knowledge proof can promote honest behavior while preserving
          privacy. The protocol can require users to submit zero-knowledge proof
          to prove their honest behavior. Because of the rationality of
          zero-knowledge proof (wrong or wrong), users must act honestly
          according to the agreement's requirements before submitting valid
          proof.
        </p>
        <p>
          MACI (Minimum Anti-Collusion Infrastructure) is an application
          scenario to promote honesty and prevent collusion in chain voting or
          other forms of decision-making. The system uses key pair and
          zero-knowledge proof technology to achieve this goal. In MACI, users
          register their public keys into a smart contract and send their votes
          to the contract through encrypted messages. MACI's anti-collusion
          feature allows voters to change their public keys to prevent others
          from knowing their voting choices. At the end of the voting period,
          the coordinator uses zero-knowledge proof to prove that they have
          processed all the messages correctly, and the final voting result is
          the sum of all valid votes. This ensures the integrity and fairness of
          the voting.
        </p>
        <p>2.1.4 Personal Information Verification</p>
        <p>
          In scenarios such as loan applications, potential borrowers can
          provide a digital certificate of income obtained from their
          affiliates. The authenticity of this certificate can be verified using
          cryptographic means. Using zero-knowledge proof protocols, banks can
          determine whether an applicant's income meets the required threshold
          while ensuring that specific and sensitive data remains undisclosed.
        </p>

        <p>
          2.1.5 Combining Machine Learning to Tap the Potential of Private Data
          Training machine learning
        </p>
        <p>
          models typically require a large amount of data. Using zero-knowledge
          proof, data owners can prove that their data meets the requirements of
          model training without exposing that data. This is conducive to making
          private data work and realizing monetization.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, zero-knowledge proof can allow model builders to prove
          that their model meets certain performance indicators. However, it is
          not necessary to disclose the details of the model to prevent others
          from copying or tampering with their model.
        </p>
        <p>2.2 Scalability</p>
        <p>
          As blockchain users increase, many executions are requested, resulting
          in transaction congestion. Some blockchains use sharding technology
          for scalability, but this requires a lot of complicated modifications
          to the basic layer of the blockchain, which may threaten the security
          of the blockchain. Another simple scheme is to take the ZK rollup
          route, use verifiable computation, outsource the computation to
          entities in another chain, and then submit the zero-knowledge proof
          and verifiable results to the main chain for verification. The
          zero-knowledge proof ensures the transaction's authenticity. The main
          chain only needs to update the results to the state without storing
          details or replaying calculations and without waiting for others to
          discuss whether the transaction is true, greatly improving efficiency
          and scalability. With the help of zero-knowledge proof, developers can
          design lightweight dapps that can run on common hardware such as
          mobile phones, which is more conducive to the popularization of Web3.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scalability of zero-knowledge proof can be applied to both the
          first-layer network, such as the Mina protocol, and the second-layer
          network ZK rollups.
        </p>
        <h4><strong> 3. How Does Zero-Knowledge Proof Work </strong></h4>
        <p>
          Dmitry Laverenov (2019) divided the zero-knowledge proof into
          interactive and non-interactive.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.1 Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof The basic form of interactive
          zero-knowledge proof consists of three steps: evidence, challenge, and
          response.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evidence: The hidden secret information is the evidence of the
          witness. This evidence establishes a series of questions that can only
          be answered correctly by people who know this information. The prover
          began to randomly select questions and send the calculated answers to
          the verifier for proof.
        </p>
        <img src="/assets/images/zkp1.png" />
        <p>
          Challenge: The verifier randomly selects another question from the set
          and asks the prover to answer it.
        </p>
        <img src="/assets/images/zkp2.png" />
        <p>
          Response: The prover accepts the question, calculates the answer, and
          returns the result to the verifier. The prover's response enables the
          verifier to check whether the prover knows the evidence.
        </p>
        <img src="/assets/images/zkp3.png" />
        <p>
          This process can be repeated many times until the probability of the
          prover guessing the correct answer without knowing the secret
          information becomes low enough. For a simplified mathematical example,
          if the probability that the prover can guess the correct answer
          without knowing the secret information is 1/2 and repeats the
          interaction ten times, the probability that the prover hits every time
          is only 0.097%, and it is extremely unlikely that the verifier will
          recognize the false proof.
        </p>
        <p>3.2 Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof</p>
        <p>
          Interactive zero-knowledge proof has its limitations. On the one hand,
          it requires a prover and verifier to exist simultaneously and to
          perform repeated verification. On the other hand, each time a new
          proof is computed, it requires the prover and verifier to transmit a
          set of information, and the proof cannot be used repeatedly in
          independent verification.
        </p>
        <p>
          To overcome the limitation of interactive zero-knowledge proof, Manuel
          Blum, Paul Feldman, and Silvio Micali proposed a non-interactive
          zero-knowledge proof, in which the prover and verifier share the key
          and need only one round of verification to make the zero-knowledge
          proof more effective. The prover computes the secret information using
          a special algorithm to generate a zero-knowledge proof and sends it to
          the verifier. The verifier uses another algorithm to check whether the
          prover knows the secret information. Once the zero-knowledge proof is
          generated, anyone with a shared key and a verification algorithm can
          verify it.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/images/zkp4.png" />
        <p>
          Non-interactive zero-knowledge proof is a breakthrough in
          zero-knowledge proof technology, which promotes the development of
          using zero-knowledge proof systems today. The main methods are
          ZK-SNARK and ZK-STARK.
        </p>
        <h4>
          <strong> 4. The Main Technical Path of Zero-Knowledge Proof </strong>
        </h4>

        <p>
          Alchemy(2022) divided the technical paths of zero-knowledge proof into
          ZK-SNARKs, ZK-STARKs, and recursive ZK-SNARK.
        </p>

        <p>4.1 ZK-SNARK</p>

        <p>
          ZK-SNARK is a succinct and non-interactive proof of zero knowledge.
        </p>
        <img src="/assets/images/zkp5.png" />
        <p>
          To ensure the correctness of transaction executions on the network,
          the public chain must let other computers (nodes) re-execute each
          transaction. However, this method requires each node to re-run each
          transaction, which slows down the speed of the network and limits
          scalability. Nodes also need to store transaction data, which leads to
          the exponential growth of the blockchain.
        </p>
        <p>
          For these limitations, ZK-SNARK plays a role. It can prove the
          correctness of the calculation outside the chain, without the need for
          nodes to replay each step of the calculation. This also eliminates the
          need for nodes to store redundant transaction data and improves
          network throughput.
        </p>
        <p>
          When SNARKs are used to verify an off-chain calculation, the
          calculation is encoded in a mathematical expression to form the
          validity proof. The verifier checks the correctness of the proof. If
          it is proven that all checks have been passed, then the underlying
          calculation is considered valid. The size of the validity proof is
          many times smaller than the calculation it verifies, so we consider
          SNARK to be succinct.
        </p>
        <p>Most ZK Rollups that use ZK-SNARK follow the following steps.</p>
        <p>
          1. Layer 2 users sign the transaction and submit it to the verifier.
        </p>

        <p>
          2. Verifier uses cryptography to compress multiple transactions to
          generate corresponding validity proofs (SNARK).
        </p>

        <p>
          3. The smart contract on the Layer 1 chain verifies the validity
          proof, which determines whether this batch of transactions will be
          released to the main chain.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is worth noting that ZK-SNARK needs to be trusted. At this stage,
          the key generator is given a program and a secret parameter to
          generate two public keys, which are used to create the proof and to
          verify the proof, respectively. These two public keys need to generate
          public parameters only once through a credible setting ‘ceremony’ and
          can be used many times by all parties wishing to participate in the
          zero-knowledge protocol. Users must believe that the participants in
          the trusted setting ceremony are not evil, and there is no way to
          evaluate the honesty of the participants. Knowing the secret
          parameters can generate fake proofs and deceive the verifier, so there
          are potential security risks. Currently, some researchers are
          exploring the scheme of ZK-SNARK without trust assumption.
        </p>
        <p>Superiority</p>

        <p>1. Security</p>

        <p>
          ZK Rollup is considered a more secure scalable scheme than OP Rollup
          because ZK-SNARK uses advanced encryption security mechanisms, and it
          is difficult to deceive the verifier and perform malicious behavior.
        </p>

        <p>2.High Throughput</p>

        <p>
          ZK-SNARK reduces the amount of computation outside Ethereum,
          alleviates the congestion of the main network, and shares the
          transaction cost with offline computations, resulting in faster
          transaction speed.
        </p>

        <p>3. Small Size of Proof</p>

        <p>
          The small size of SNARK proofs makes them easy to verify on the main
          chain, which means the gas fee of transactions under the verification
          chain is low, which reduces the cost for users.
        </p>

        <p>Limit</p>
        <p>1. Relative centralization</p>

        <p>
          Most of the time, it depends on a trusted setting. This is contrary to
          the original intention of blockchain to trust.
        </p>

        <p>
          Generating validity certificates with ZK-SNARK is a computationally
          intensive process, and the certifier must invest in specialized
          hardware. These hardware are expensive and only a few people can
          afford them, so the proof process of ZK-SNARK is highly centralized.
        </p>

        <p>2. Threat from Quantum Computing</p>

        <p>
          ZK-SNARK uses elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to encrypt the
          information used to generate validity certificates, which is
          relatively security at present. However, the progress of quantum
          computing may break its security model.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Projects Using ZK-SNARK</strong></p>

        <p>Polygon Hermez</p>

        <p>
          Polygon acquired Hermez for $250 million in 2021, becoming the first
          case of a comprehensive merger of two blockchain networks. The ZK
          technology and tools from Hermez support Polygon to develop zkEVM.
          Hermez 1.0 is a payment platform that executes a series of off-chain
          transactions, allowing users to conveniently transfer ERC-20 tokens
          from one Hermez account to another, and transactions per second can
          reach 2000 times. Hermez 2.0 transparently executes Ethereum
          transactions, including smart contracts with zero-knowledge
          verification. It can be fully compatible with Ethereum without too
          many changes to the smart contract code, which is convenient for
          developers to deploy Layer 1 projects on Polygon Hermez. Hermez 1.0
          uses SNARK proofs, and 2.0 uses both SNARK and STARK proofs
          simultaneously. In 2.0, STARK-proof is used to prove the effectiveness
          of off-chain transactions. However, the cost of verifying STARK-proof
          on the main chain is very high, so SNARK-proof is introduced to verify
          STARK.
        </p>

        <p>zkSync</p>

        <p>
          ZkSync 1.0, launched by Matter Labs in 2020, does not support smart
          contracts and is mainly used for transactions or transfers. ZkSync
          2.0, which supports smart contracts, was publicly launched on the main
          network in March 2023.
        </p>

        <p>
          ZkSync compiles Solidity, the source code of smart contracts in
          Ethereum, into Yul to realize EVM compatibility. Yul is an
          intermediate language that can be compiled into bytecodes of different
          EVMs. Using the LLVM compiler framework, Yul code can be recompiled
          into a custom, circuit-compatible bytecode set designed for zkEVM of
          zkSync. This method eliminates the need to prove all EVM execution
          steps through higher-level code, making it easier to decentralize the
          proof process while maintaining high performance. In the future,
          support for Rust, Javascript, or other languages can be added by
          building a new compiler front end, increasing the flexibility of the
          zkEVM architecture and attracting more developers.
        </p>

        <p>Aztec</p>

        <p>
          Aztec is the first hybrid zkRollup, which can implement public and
          private smart contracts in one environment. This is a zero-knowledge
          execution environment, not zkEVM. Confidentiality and audibility are
          achieved by merging public and private execution into a single mixed
          rollup, such as public AMM's private transaction, public game's
          private messaging, public DAO's private voting, and so on.
        </p>

        <p>4.2 ZK-STARK</p>

        <p>
          ZK-STARK doesn't require credible settings. ZK-STARK is an acronym for
          Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Knowledge Argument. Compared to
          ZK-SNARK, ZK-STARK is more scalable and transparent.
        </p>

        <img src="assets/images/zkp6.png" />

        <p>Superiority</p>

        <p>1. Trustless</p>
        <p>
          ZK-STARK replaces trusted settings with open verifiable randomness,
          which reduces the dependence on participants and improves the
          protocol's security.
        </p>

        <p>2. Greater scaling ability</p>
        <p>
          Even though the complexity of the underlying computing increases
          exponentially, ZK-STARK still maintains a low proof and verification
          time, rather than a linear growth like ZK-SNARK.
        </p>

        <p>3. Higher security guarantee ZK-STARK uses an anti-collision</p>
        <p>
          hash value for encryption instead of the elliptic curve scheme used in
          ZK-SNARK, which can resist the attack of quantum computing.
        </p>

        <p>Limit</p>
        <p>
          1. Larger Proof Size The ZK-STARK proof size is larger, which makes
          the verification in the main network higher.
        </p>

        <p>2. Low Adoption Rate</p>
        <p>
          ZK-SNARK is the first practical application of zero-knowledge proof in
          blockchain, so most ZK Rollups adopt ZK-SNARK, which has more mature
          developer systems and tools. Although ZK-STARK is also supported by
          the Ethereum Foundation, the adoption rate is relatively low, and the
          basic developer tools need to be improved.
        </p>

        <p><strong> Projects Using ZK-STARK </strong></p>

        <p>Polygon Miden</p>
        <p>
          Polygon Miden, a scalable solution based on Ethereum L2, uses zk-STARK
          technology to integrate a large number of Layer 2 transactions into a
          single Ethereum transaction, thus improving the processing capacity
          and reducing the transaction cost. Without sharding, Polygon Miden can
          generate a block in 5 seconds, and its TPS can reach more than 1000.
          After sharding, the TPS can be as high as 10,000. Users only take 15
          minutes to withdraw funds from Polygon Miden to Ethereum. The core
          function of Polygon Miden is a Turing complete virtual machine based
          on STARK-MidenVM, which makes the formal verification of contracts
          easier.
        </p>
        <p>StarkEx and StarkNet</p>
        <p>
          StarkEx is a framework of scaling solutions customized for specific
          applications. The project can use StarkEx to carry out low-cost and
          off-chain computations to generate STARK proof to prove the
          correctness of execution. Such a proof contains 12,000–500,000
          transactions. Finally, the proof is sent to the STARK verifier on the
          chain, and the status update is accepted after the verification is
          correct. The applications deployed on StarkEx include dYdX(perpetual
          futures), Immutable X(L2 NFT market), Sorare(sports digital card
          trading market), and Rhino.fi(multi-chain DeFi aggregator).
        </p>
        <p>
          StarkNet is an L2 without permission, in which anyone can deploy smart
          contracts developed in the Cairo language. Contracts deployed on
          StarkNet can interact to build new composable protocols. Unlike
          StarkEx, where the application is responsible for submitting
          transactions, StarkNet's sorter batches transactions and sends them
          for processing and certification. StarkNet is more suitable for
          protocols that need synchronous interaction with other protocols or
          are beyond the application scope of StarkEx. With the development of
          StarkNet, applications based on StarkEx can be transplanted to
          StarkNet and enjoy composability.

        <img src="/assets/images/zkp7.png" />

        <p>4.3 Recursive ZK-SNARK</p>

        <p>
          Ordinary ZK rollups can only handle one transaction block, which
          limits the number of transactions they can handle. Recursive ZK-SNARK
          can verify more than one transaction block, merge the SNARKs generated
          by different L2 blocks into a single validity proof, and submit it to
          the L1 chain. Once the contract on the L1 chain accepts the submitted
          proof, all of these transactions become effective, greatly increasing
          the number of transactions that can ultimately be completed with
          zero-knowledge proof.
        </p>

        <p>
          Plonky2 is a new proof mechanism from Polygon Zero that uses recursive
          ZK SNARK to increase the number of transactions. Recursive SNARK
          extends the proof generation process by aggregating multiple proofs
          into a single recursive proof. Plonky2 uses the same technology to
          reduce the time it takes to generate new block proofs. Plonky2
          generates thousands of transactions in parallel and recursively
          aggregates them into a block proof, so the generation speed is fast.
          However, the usual proofing mechanism tries to generate the entire
          block proof at once, which is less efficient. In addition, Plonky2 can
          also generate proofs on consumer devices, solving the hardware
          centralization problem often associated with SNARK proofs.
        </p>

        <h4>
          <strong> 5. Zero Knowledge Rollup VS Optimistic Rollup </strong>
        </h4>

        <p>
          ZK-SNARK and ZK-STARK have become the core infrastructure for
          blockchain scaling solutions, especially in the Zero-Knowledge Rollup
          scheme. Zero-Knowledge Rollup refers to a layer2 scaling solution of
          Ethereum, which uses zero-knowledge proof technology to move all
          computations offline to reduce network congestion. The main advantage
          of Zero-Knowledge Rollup is that it can greatly improve the
          transaction throughput of Ethereum while keeping the transaction cost
          low, and once the transaction is packaged into the rollup, it can be
          determined instantly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, in addition to Zero Knowledge Rollup, there is also Optimal
          Rollup in the L2 scaling solution of Ethereum. Transactions running in
          Optimal Rollup are validated by default and immediately executed. The
          transaction will be revoked only if a fraudulent transaction is
          detected (someone submits fraud-proof). Therefore, the security is
          lower than the zero-knowledge rollup. Optimal Rollup has a challenging
          period to prevent fraudulent transactions, which causes users to wait
          for seven days to get their money back after requesting to withdraw.
        </p>

        <p>
          EVM was originally designed without considering the use of
          zero-knowledge proof technology. Vitalik, the founder of Ethereum,
          believes that zero-knowledge rollup is technically complicated in the
          short term but will eventually defeat optimal rollup in the scaling
          war. Below is a comparison between zero-knowledge rollup and optimal
          rollup.

          <strong>
            6. What is the Future of Zero-Knowledge Proof Technology
            Application?</strong
          >
        </h4>

        <p>
          The field of zero-knowledge proof technology is in a unique position:
          With a great deal of effort in recent years being devoted to advancing
          research in the field, many results are fairly new within the field of
          cryptography and secure communication. As a result, the research and
          development community has yet to answer many intriguing questions. At
          the same time, zero-knowledge proof technology is being implemented in
          a wide variety of projects, showcasing challenges and expanding the
          requirements of zero-knowledge technology.
        </p>

        <p>
          One area of zero-knowledge proof technology that should be observed is
          the discussion on post-quantum security of zero-knowledge proof
          technology. Publicly verifiable SNARKs (succinct non-interactive
          arguments of knowledge) are a key component within the field of
          zero-knowledge technology. However, most of the widely used publicly
          verifiable SNARK schemes are not considered to be quantum-safe.
          Examples of this are Groth16, Sonic, Marlin, SuperSonic, and Spartan.
          These schemes rely on mathematical problems that can be efficiently
          solved with the help of quantum computers, effectively compromising
          their security in a post-quantum world.
        </p>

        <p>
          We observe that the research community is intensely working on finding
          quantum-safe zero-knowledge proofs, which can be used for a variety of
          statements having no preprocessing phase. Current examples of
          state-of-the-art quantum-safe zero-knowledge proofs are schemes like
          Ligero, Aurora, Fractal, Lattice Bulletproofs, and LPK22. Ligero,
          Aurora, and Fractal are based on hash functions, while Lattice
          Bulletproofs and LKP22 are based on lattice functions. Both of these
          functions are considered to have the potential to be quantum-safe. We
          see the trend of generalizing these schemes as well as increasing
          their efficiency.
        </p>

          Another aspect we expect in the future of zero-knowledge technology is
          its resilience to attacks and maturity of implementations. Given the
          increase in the amount of code being written, there will be more safe
          and reviewed libraries to be used for all kinds of zero-knowledge
          proof technology, as well as best practices being discussed and agreed
          on, and common errors being identified and communicated. In addition
          to this, as we expect the field to mature and be highly adopted,
          efforts to standardize protocols will take place and ensure
          interoperability between different implementations. This is already
          starting with a project called ZKProof.
        </p>

          Another trend that will continue to exist within the zero-knowledge
          community is for more work on efficient algorithms and possibly
          special hardware. We have already seen advancements made to have proof
          sizes being reduced as well as provers and verifiers being made more
          efficient over the recent years. Advancements in algorithms, special
          hardware, and computational optimizations may lead to faster and more
          scalable implementations.
        </p>

        <p>
          While the efficiency of existing algorithms is beneficial to the users
          of zero-knowledge proof technology in the future, we also expect to
          see widening functionalities for zero-knowledge proofs. In the past,
          we encountered many instances in implementations of preprocessing
          zk-SNARK. Now we are finding more and more instances of updatable
          zk-SNARK. Also, some zero-knowledge proof technology is being used for
          its succinctness property more than its zero-knowledge capability.
        </p>

        <p>
          Lastly, another trend we are observing for zero-knowledge proof
          technology is the intersection of machine learning techniques with
          zero-knowledge proof techniques. The idea entails to train large
          language models in a multi-party setting and using zero-knowledge
          technology for verifying the computation. This could be quite useful
          for the efficiency of current artificial intelligence and potential
          projects emerging in this sphere seem likely.
